Customer Churn Detection
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting.

Project Overview
Customer churn is a significant challenge for many businesses, as it represents the loss of customers to competitors. Identifying the factors that lead to churn and predicting which customers are likely to leave can help businesses take proactive steps to retain them. This project aims to build models that can accurately predict customer churn based on various features.

Dataset
Source: [Your Data Source]
Size: [Number of records] customer records.
Features:
Various customer attributes such as demographics, account information, and service usage.
Churn label: 1 for customers who churned and 0 for those who stayed.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-detection.git
cd customer-churn-detection
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset:

Place the dataset in the project directory.

Usage
Data Preprocessing
Load the dataset and perform initial exploration.
Handle missing values and ensure the Churn target variable is binary.
Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features from raw data.
Scale the features to ensure better model performance.
Modeling
Logistic Regression:

Train a logistic regression model with scaled features.
Address convergence issues by increasing max_iter or scaling data.
Gradient Boosting:

Train a Gradient Boosting Classifier.
Ensure the target variable is correctly encoded as binary integers.
Evaluation
Metrics: The models are evaluated using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, and Confusion Matrix.
Address Class Imbalance: Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE can be used to handle class imbalance.
Running the Project
To train and evaluate the models:

python
Copy code
python churn_detection.py
This script will load the data, preprocess it, train both Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting models, and evaluate their performance.

Results
Logistic Regression:

Provided a baseline model with strong interpretability.
Achieved good accuracy with a balanced trade-off between precision and recall.
Gradient Boosting:

Improved the modelâ€™s ability to capture non-linear relationships.
Demonstrated superior performance in terms of ROC-AUC and overall accuracy.
